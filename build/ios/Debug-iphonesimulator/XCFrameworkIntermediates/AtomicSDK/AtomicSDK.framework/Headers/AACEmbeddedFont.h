/**
 Represents an embedded font, which is integrated into the project bundle. When an embedded
 font is specified, this local font will be used instead of downloading a font file from a remote URL, 
 as specified in your stream container theme. The font family name, weight and style must match 
 exactly for an embedded font to be used.
 Steps to use an embedded font:
 1. Set up the font in a theme within the Atomic Workbench;
 2. Add the font file to the project - make sure you also include it in your app target.
 3. Call [AACSession registerEmbeddedFonts:] after the application is launched, passing an array of embedded
 fonts you wish to use.
