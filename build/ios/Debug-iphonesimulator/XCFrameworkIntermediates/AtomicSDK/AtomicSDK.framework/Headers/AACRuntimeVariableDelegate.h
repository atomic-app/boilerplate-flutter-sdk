 Delegate method that can be implemented when one or more cards include runtime variables.
 If the card includes runtime variables to be resolved, the SDK will call this method to ask that you resolve them.
 If this method is not implemented, or you do not resolve a given variable, the default values for that variable
 will be used (as defined in the Atomic Workbench).
 
 Variables are resolved on each card by calling `resolveRuntimeVariableWithName:value:`.
