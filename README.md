# Multiple Containers Demo App

The first demo app for Atomic.io. This app is to demonstrate the impact having a complex Flutter implementation of the Atomic SDK can have on the app's performance and user experience. It has many containers, state changes, and animations.

In the app root directory, remember to create a `.env` file with the following set:
```
API_KEY=''
API_URL=''
USER_ID=''
```

Also, remember to place the generated `jwtRS512.key` file in an assets folder in the app root directory like this: `assets/jwtRS512.key`
